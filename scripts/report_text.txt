Description
 
1.1
 
Problem
 
Statement
 
Emergency
 
response
 
systems
 
must
 
handle
 
multiple
 
incidents
 
simultaneously
 
while
 
operating
 
under
 
limited
 
resources
 
such
 
as
 
police
 
cars,
 
ambulances,
 
and
 
fire
 
trucks.
 
Traditional
 
dispatch
 
systems
 
rely
 
on
 
fixed
 
rules
 
or
 
human
 
operators,
 
which
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
inefficient
 
decisions
 
when
 
incidents
 
compete
 
for
 
resources,
 
urgency
 
changes
 
over
 
time,
 
or
 
unexpected
 
emergencies
 
occur.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
an
 
intelligent
 
system
 
that
 
can
 
reason
 
dynamically
 
about
 
emergencies,
 
resource
 
availability,
 
urgency
 
escalation,
 
and
 
future
 
system
 
risks
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
make
 
effective
 
dispatch
 
decisions
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
 
1.2
 
Project
 
Objectives
 
The
 
objectives
 
of
 
this
 
project
 
are:
 
●
 
To
 
design
 
a
 
knowledge-based
 
emergency
 
dispatcher
 
using
 
Prolog.
 
 
●
 
To
 
represent
 
emergency
 
incidents,
 
services,
 
units,
 
and
 
environment
 
knowledge
 
as
 
facts.
 
 
●
 
To
 
reason
 
about
 
urgency,
 
resource
 
availability,
 
and
 
system
 
pressure
.
 
 
●
 
To
 
dynamically
 
dispatch,
 
delay,
 
or
 
reassign
 
emergency
 
units
 
based
 
on
 
priority.
 
 
●
 
To
 
support
 
non-monotonic
 
reasoning
,
 
allowing
 
decisions
 
to
 
be
 
revised
 
when
 
new
 
incidents
 
occur.
 
 
●
 
To
 
provide
 
explainable
 
reasoning
 
for
 
every
 
decision
 
made
 
by
 
the
 
system.
 
 
1.3
 
Project

The
 
project
 
is
 
developed
 
in
 
the
 
following
 
stages:

(incidents,
 
units,
 
services).
 
 
2.
 
Rule
 
development
 
for
 
service
 
selection
 
and
 
unit
 
assignment.

collaboration
 
and

System
 
Architecture
 
Architectural
 
Overview
 
The
 
system
 
is
 
designed
 
using
 
a
 
layered
 
architecture
 
that
 
separates
 
user
 
interaction,
 
system
 
control,
 
and
 
knowledge-based
 
reasoning.
 
This
 
separation
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
emergency
 
dispatcher
 
agent
 
can
 
reason
 
autonomously
 
while
 
allowing
 
users
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
the
 
system
 
through
 
a
 
web-based
 
interface.
 
At
 
a
 
high
 
level,
 
the
 
system
 
consists
 
of
 
three
 
main
 
components:
 
1.
 
User
 
Interface
 
Layer
 
 
2.
 
System
 
Control
 
Layer
 
 
3.
 
Knowledge-Based
 
Reasoning
 
Layer
 
 
Each
 
component
 
has
 
a
 
clearly
 
defined
 
responsibility,
 
enabling
 
modular
 
development
 
and
 
future
 
extensibility.
 
 
3.1
 
User
 
Interface
 
Layer
 
The
 
User
 
Interface
 
Layer
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
all
 
interactions
 
between
 
the
 
user
 
and
 
the
 
system.
 
Its
 
main
 
responsibilities
 
include:
 
●
 
Displaying
 
a
 
graph-based
 
city
 
environment
 
consisting
 
of
 
road
 
intersections
 
(nodes),
 
road
 
segments
 
(edges),
 
and
 
buildings
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
road
 
network.
 
●
 
Rendering
 
the
 
road
 
network
 
using
 
node
 
coordinates
 
and
 
edge
 
geometry,
 
and
 
animating
 
emergency
 
units
 
along
 
computed
 
shortest
 
paths
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
 
●
 
Allowing
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
report
 
new
 
emergency
 
incidents
 
by
 
selecting
 
a
 
location
 
and
 
specifying
 
incident
 
details
 
 
●
 
Visualizing
 
active
 
incidents,
 
emergency
 
units,
 
and
 
their
 
statuses
 
 
●
 
Presenting
 
system-generated
 
explanations
 
for
 
dispatch
 
decisions
 
 
●
 
Displaying
 
system
 
load
 
and
 
resource
 
availability
 
information
 
 

--- Page 8 ---

The
 
user
 
interface
 
visualizes
 
the
 
geometric
 
representation
 
of
 
the
 
city
 
using
 
node
 
coordinates,
 
while
 
path
 
computation
 
and
 
travel
 
time
 
calculations
 
are
 
handled
 
by
 
the
 
backend
 
system.
 
This
 
layer
 
does
 
not
 
contain
 
any
 
decision-making
 
logic.
 
All
 
information
 
displayed
 
to
 
the
 
user
 
is
 
derived
 
from
 
the
 
system’s
 
internal
 
state
 
and
 
reasoning
 
outcomes.
 
 
3.2
 
System
 
Control
 
Layer
 
The
 
System
 
Control
 
Layer
 
acts
 
as
 
the
 
intermediary
 
between
 
the
 
user
 
interface
 
and
 
the
 
reasoning
 
engine.
 
Its
 
responsibilities
 
include:
 
●
 
Receiving
 
incident
 
data
 
submitted
 
by
 
the
 
user
 
 
●
 
Managing
 
the
 
current
 
system
 
state,
 
including
 
incidents
 
and
 
unit
 
statuses
 
 
●
 
Communicating
 
with
 
the
 
knowledge-based
 
reasoning
 
layer
 
 
●
 
Triggering
 
re-evaluation
 
of
 
decisions
 
when
 
system
 
conditions
 
change
 
 
●
 
Maintaining
 
a
 
graph
 
data
 
structure
 
representing
 
intersections,
 
buildings,
 
and
 
road
 
segments,
 
including
 
edge
 
weights
 
corresponding
 
to
 
travel
 
distance.
 
 
●
 
Synchronizing
 
real-time
 
updates
 
between
 
the
 
backend
 
and
 
frontend
 
 
This
 
layer
 
ensures
 
that
 
user
 
input
 
is
 
properly
 
translated
 
into
 
system
 
facts
 
and
 
that
 
reasoning
 
results
 
are
 
consistently
 
reflected
 
in
 
the
 
user
 
interface.
 
 
3.3
 
Knowledge-Based
 
Reasoning
 
Layer
 
The
 
Knowledge-Based
 
Reasoning
 
Layer
 
is
 
the
 
core
 
intelligence
 
of
 
the
 
system.
 
It
 
is
 
responsible
 
for:
 
●
 
Representing
 
incidents,
 
emergency
 
units,
 
services,
 
and
 
environment
 
data
 
as
 
facts
 
 
●
 
Reasoning
 
about
 
incident
 
urgency
 
and
 
required
 
services
 
 

--- Page 9 ---

●
 
Selecting
 
appropriate
 
emergency
 
units
 
using
 
knowledge-based
 
rules
 
 
●
 
Performing
 
temporal
 
reasoning
 
for
 
urgency
 
escalation
 
 
●
 
Supporting
 
non-monotonic
 
reasoning
 
to
 
allow
 
reassignment
 
of
 
units
 
 
●
 
Generating
 
structured
 
explanations
 
for
 
dispatch
 
decisions
 
 
This
 
layer
 
operates
 
independently
 
of
 
the
 
user
 
interface
 
and
 
focuses
 
entirely
 
on
 
reasoning
 
and
 
decision-making.
 
 
3.4
 
Data
 
and
 
Communication
 
Flow
 
The
 
interaction
 
between
 
system
 
components
 
follows
 
this
 
flow:
 
1.
 
The
 
user
 
reports
 
an
 
incident
 
through
 
the
 
user
 
interface.
 
 
2.
 
The
 
system
 
control
 
layer
 
processes
 
the
 
input
 
and
 
updates
 
the
 
system
 
state.
 
 
3.
 
The
 
knowledge-based
 
reasoning
 
layer
 
evaluates
 
the
 
situation
 
and
 
determines
 
dispatch
 
decisions.
 
 
4.
 
The
 
reasoning
 
results
 
and
 
explanations
 
are
 
returned
 
to
 
the
 
system
 
control
 
layer.
 
 
5.
 
The
 
user
 
interface
 
is
 
updated
 
in
 
real
 
time
 
to
 
reflect
 
the
 
new
 
system
 
state.
 
 
This
 
architecture
 
ensures
 
that
 
all
 
decisions
 
are
 
driven
 
by
 
inferred
 
knowledge
 
rather
 
than
 
hardcoded
 
behavior.
 
 
Architectural
 
Justification
 
The
 
selected
 
system
 
architecture
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
clearly
 
separate
 
user
 
interaction,
 
system
 
control,
 
and
 
knowledge-based
 
reasoning.
 
This
 
separation
 
of
 
concerns
 
allows
 
each
 
component
 
to
 
be
 
developed,
 
tested,
 
and
 
modified
 
independently,
 
supporting
 
modular
 
system
 
development.
 
By
 
isolating
 
the
 
reasoning
 
logic
 
from
 
the
 
presentation
 
layer,
 
the
 
dispatcher
 
agent
 
can
 
focus
 
entirely
 
on
 
intelligent
 
decision-making
 
without
 
being
 
affected
 
by
 
user

The

explainable

reasoning,
 
as
 
all

decisions
 
are
 
generated
 
by
 
the

layer

In

the
 
layered
 
design
 
supports
 
real-time
 
responsiveness
 
by
 
allowing
 
system

to
 
be
 
handled
 
efficiently.
 
Finally,
 
the

allows
 
future
 
extensions,
 
such

additional

to
